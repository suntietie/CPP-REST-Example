# C++ Project Template for CMake

> Can be used in Visual Studio Code

Skeleton Code for cmake usage and cpprestsdk.

Steps for mac OS:


1. `brew install cmake`
2. `brew install cpprestsdk`
3. open Project in VS Code
4. install VSCode extensions:
   - [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)
   - CMake
   - cmake-format
5. Command + Shift + P and type `CMake: Configure`
6. This will create a subfolder called `build`. Once you do this, a new button on the left `Activity Bar` in Visual Studio Code will appear which allows you to run and debug the targets.
7. `./build/cppstarter`

If you are in different OS, please refer to this [link](https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk) to install packages, and cmake steps will be the same.
